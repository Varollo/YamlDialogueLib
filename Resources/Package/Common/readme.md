# YAML Dialogue Lib

This is *.Net Standard* library for personal use in my ~~(and yours, if you wish)~~ games. It interprets a `.yaml` file in this custom [schema](./schema.json) into C# with a Enumerator class.

The intention behind using YAML for scripting the dialogue was to keep it simple. YAML is a very "human readable" markup language, therefore with some basic instructions, or following the schema, anyone could use this library to make dialogue for their games, regardless of programming experience.
